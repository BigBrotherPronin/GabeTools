This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Study Materials

The application includes a study materials section where users can view and download educational resources. To add or update study materials:

1. Create the following directory in the `public` folder if it doesn't exist:
   - `public/study-materials/structural-materials/` - For all structural engineering materials

2. Add your files directly to this directory.

3. Restart the application or redeploy for changes to take effect.

Each file can be downloaded individually. The download functionality is protected by a password. The default password is `engineering123`, which can be changed in the `study-materials/page.tsx` file.
